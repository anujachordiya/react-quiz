React Quiz App

This is a simple quiz application built with React. The app allows users to answer the questions and provides feedback on their performance. It includes a timer for each question, highlighting selected answers, and displaying whether the answer was correct or incorrect.

Features

Timer: Each question has a countdown timer to add a sense of urgency.
Answer Selection: Users can select answers, and their selection is highlighted.
Answer Feedback: After answering, the selected answer is marked green if correct, and red if incorrect.
Quiz Summary: At the end of the quiz, the user sees a summary of their answers.

Technologies Used

React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
CSS: For styling the quiz and its components.
JavaScript: For handling logic and state management.


Getting Started
Prerequisites

To run the project locally, you will need:
Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer.
npm: Node.js package manager (comes with Node.js installation).


How It Works

Question Flow: The quiz presents one question at a time. The user can select an answer from multiple choices.
Timer: Each question has a countdown timer. The timer starts when the question is displayed and ends when the user selects an answer or the timer runs out.
Answer Evaluation: After the user selects an answer, it is evaluated. If the answer is correct, it is highlighted in green; if incorrect, it is highlighted in red.
Quiz Completion: Once all questions are answered or skipped, a summary screen is displayed showing the user's answers
